# CC-AfterHours-AnimatedView
CC's After Hours project with more practice on view animations.

## Step 1: Setup
1. Create a new Xcode project.
2. Delete the `ViewController.swift` file. 
3. Drag in a square picture to the `Assets` folder.

## Step 2: Storyboard
### Main View Controller:
1. Place a **label** and constrain it near the top/center of the view. Name it `Main VC`. 
2. Place a **table view** beneath the **label** and add constraints. 
3. Embed this **view controller** in a `Navigation Controller`. 
### Animated View Controller:
1. Drag out a **view controller**. Place it in front of the `Navigation Controller` scene. 
2. Place an **image view** and constrain it in the center horizontally and vertically. Give it a width and height of 300. 
3. Choose the photo from `Assets` for this **image view**. 
4. Make sure this **view controller** is the `initial view`. 
### Launchscreen:
1. Go to `Launchscreen.storyboard`. 
2. Place an **image view** and constrain it in the center horizontally and vertically. Give it a width and height of 300. 
3. Choose the same photo from `Assets` as you did previously for this **image view**.

## Step 3: The Magic
### Main View Controller:
1. Create a new `UIViewController` file. Name it `MainViewController`. 
### Animated View Controller:
1. Create a new `UIViewController` file. Name it `AnimatedViewController`. 
2. Create an **outlet** for your **imageView**. 
3. Create a **function** called `animateImage()`
4. Add two animations, one for **scaling** and one for **opacity**.
5. Create a **segue programmatically**, and give it a delay of 3 seconds on the `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`
6. Call your function in `viewDidAppear`.
